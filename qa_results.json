You've crossed $100 million in AI revenue run rate, you've launched Snowflake Intelligence, Cortex AI adoption is accelerating with over 3,200 accounts \u2014 yet the expansion rate continues to deteriorate. Your 10-Q explicitly flags risk around customers' ability to 'maintain and increase consumption on your platform.' At what point should investors conclude that AI workloads are incremental but fundamentally insufficient to offset the structural compression in your core data warehousing expansion rates? And can you give us a specific timeline for when you expect NRR to stabilize or inflect?",

With 688 customers now spending over $1 million, up 27% year-over-year, but NRR at historic lows, can you quantify the expected payback period on this sales investment?

      "response": "Thank you for the direct question. You're right that NRR at 125% represents continued compression, and I won't sugarcoat that \u2014 it reflects the natural maturation of our largest cohorts and the optimization behaviors we've seen industry-wide. However, I'd push back on the characterization that AI is insufficient: we crossed $100 million in AI revenue run rate a quarter ahead of schedule, we added 146 customers spending over $1 million this year alone \u2014 that's 27% growth \u2014 and our RPO of $6.9 billion, up 21%, signals strong forward commitment. What gives me confidence is that NRR is a trailing indicator while our leading indicators \u2014 3,200-plus Cortex accounts, four nine-figure deals this quarter, and 29% product revenue growth \u2014 are inflecting positively. We expect NRR to stabilize in the first half of fiscal 2027 as these AI workloads scale and our newer products like Snowflake Intelligence move from adoption to meaningful consumption."

      },
      "response": "Let me be direct with you - these partnerships aren't an admission of weakness, they're a recognition that enterprise data is fragmented across dozens of systems, and customers are demanding interoperability. Our SAP partnership announced November 4th brings Snowflake's AI Data Cloud directly into SAP's Business Data Fabric with native integration and zero-copy data sharing - the incremental value versus alternatives is that SAP customers can leverage our Cortex AI capabilities, including our Anthropic partnership, directly on their enterprise data without extraction or duplication. The proof is in our execution: we just delivered $1.16 billion in product revenue, up 29% year-over-year, added 146 customers spending over $1 million, and crossed $100 million in AI revenue run rate - that's not the profile of a company that can't compete. On Palantir, they bring deep vertical expertise in defense and government that complements our platform strengths, and this quarter alone we signed four nine-figure deals, so clearly enterprises see us as the center of gravity for their data workloads regardless of which analytics tools sit on top."

      },
      "response": "Thank you for the warm welcome, and it's a fair question to tackle head-on. You're right that we've made significant sales investments, and yes, operating margin ticked down this quarter as a result \u2014 that's a deliberate trade-off we're making given the AI opportunity in front of us. On the RPO versus product revenue dynamic, I'd note that our consumption model means revenue recognition often runs ahead of bookings cycles, and we actually added four nine-figure deals this quarter with strong customer commitment. Regarding payback periods, we're targeting 12 to 18 months for new sales capacity, and the early cohorts from our H1 hiring are already contributing \u2014 our 688 million-dollar customers growing 27% year-over-year reflects that productivity. On NRR at 125%, I won't sugarcoat it \u2014 that's our lowest, but it's stabilizing, and importantly, our newer products like Cortex AI, now at $100 million-plus run rate, aren't yet fully reflected in that trailing metric. For fiscal 2027, we expect some near-term margin pressure as this capacity absorbs, but we have line of sight to operating leverage as these investments mature and AI workloads scale."
